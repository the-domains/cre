            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Time Costs Money and Kills Deals</h1><p>Scenario 1: The tenant and the landlord have finally agreed to essential business terms through a month long back and forth negotiation. So, the terms of the final LOI are incorporated into the actual lease by the Landlord, which is 50 pages long of dense legalese, and another 40 pages of exhibits. The tenant's attorney marks up this extremely pro-landlord lease and sends it back to the landlord's attorney. Only a couple of changes are accepted in this go around. The attorneys keep negotiating, while undoubtedly telling their clients that the other side isÂ  being completely unreasonable and that that the lease, as the other side wants, gives their own side to much liability. All of this back and forth takes an additional 8 weeks until the final lease is signed, if at all. It took three entire months to negotiate the final LOI and lease, with thousands of dollars being paid to the attorneys.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d9ebf71bd2a438026176b9e4e489d9f0cf0874fe.jpg"></article>]]></description>
