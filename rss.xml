            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Tenant Shall Do This But Landlord Shall Do That</h1><p>If you are working on a lease or any other contract for that matter, one should really stop using the word "shall." With contracts, especially leases, shall has two different meanings. Shall has two different meanings, "must" or "will." One is a requirement, and one is a requirement or action that will be done in the future.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0da155c2cbb61dcf60bbf9d36fed62ab73a42752.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Severablity Clauses in Commercial Leases</h1><p>Severability clauses are boilerplate these days, especially in commercial leases.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Art of Deal Making II</h1><p>In the commercial real estate world, parties often negotiate through letters of intent (LOI). Usually, these are one to two pages in length and outline the major terms of a deal. Such terms include how much rent, the size of the space to lease and the length of the term.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e5a786100e36c5adfcd406960b402a98b651453c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ready, Set, Go! Timing in Leases</h1><p>Time frames are crucial in leases. That's one of the benefits of having a simple, straight forward lease. It makes it easy to know when something happens. After all, the landlord certainly wants to know when they can start getting rent. The tenant certainly needs to know when they have to start paying rent.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6cb260c9a6c509007dab6327d888d0b0d763a0d1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Will Sell Fruit, including Bananas, Oranges, Grapes, Pears and Plums.</h1><p>There is often a lot of redundancy in leases and such redundancy can turn a great lease into a bad lease. Just look at the title of this post. The "including Bananas, Oranges, Grapes, Pears, and Plumbs" is completely redundant. Those are all different kinds of fruit.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/909812c6bf3c61566b222ee31b323307022bed46.jpg"></article>]]></description>

As a tenant the best time to plan for your lease renewal is before you even sign the initial lease. At this time, you as the tenant have a much stronger negotiating position.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2ac5b886dca316c3b9de64be2e1c716ae64f9760.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Remember, Time Costs Money</h1><p>Using a simple lease will probably increase the net worth of both landlord and tenant by saving time with lease negotiations. This can easily be demonstrated with two scenarios: Scenario 1: The tenant and the landlord have finally agreed to essential business terms through a month long back and forth negotiation.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/37a0eebf3339929489186fbe328b82e585e40da1.jpg"></article>]]></description>
